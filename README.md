# Emergent Space Technologies Internship - Summer 2021

This code powers my summer 2021 internship project which is
a device that physically points to satellites as they pass from
horizon to horizon.

The "experimental code" directory contains test pieces of code that let me test and understand
different concepts. The "project code" contains all the real code powering the Raspberry Pi and
microcontrollers onboard the device.
